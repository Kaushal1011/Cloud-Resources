## Databases: [Big Data](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27745/big-data) Introduction

Big data refers to a process that is used when traditional data mining and handling techniques cannot uncover the insights and meaning of the underlying data. Data that is unstructured or time sensitive or simply very large cannot be processed by relational database engines. This type of data requires a different processing approach called big data, which uses massive parallelism on readily-available hardware.

Topics related to Big Data include:

- Analytics
- Architecture
- High Performance Computing
- Streaming Data
- Visualization

## Databases: Big Data General

ig data can be described in terms of data management challenges that – due to increasing volume, velocity and variety of data – cannot be solved with traditional databases. While there are plenty of definitions for big data, most of them include the concept of what’s commonly known as the “three V’s” of big data:

- Volume: Ranges from terabytes to petabytes of data
- Variety: Includes data from a wide range of sources and formats (e.g. web logs, social media interactions, ecommerce and online transactions, financial transactions, etc)
- Velocity: Increasingly, businesses have stringent requirements from the time data is generated, to the time actionable insights are delivered to the users. Therefore, data needs to be collected, stored, processed, and analyzed within relatively short windows – ranging from daily to real-time.
